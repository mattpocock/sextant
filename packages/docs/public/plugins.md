# Plugins

Plugins are what give Sextant its power. Not only can you diagram an application - you can take those diagrams and turn them into code.

You can [create your own plugins](advanced#creating-a-plugin), or choose from those built by the community.

Most of our plugins currently work with Javascript, but **Sextant plugins can produce any language of code**. Really. The sky's the limit.

> If you've got an idea for a plugin you'd like to see - submit an issue at our [repository](https://github.com/mattpocock/sextant)! We'd love to hear about it.

## Javascript

All our Javascript plugins can be used with Typescript. We generate full `.d.ts` files.
